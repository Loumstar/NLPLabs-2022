This module also provides a range of useful functionalities for data preparation: defining a preprocessing pipeline, splitting, batching, padding, iterating through data, loading pre-trained embeddings, building vocabulary, etc. Below we provide an example using the tokenizer as provided by the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) toolkit.\n",

For this bigger dataset, use `.cuda()` on any input batches/tensors, network modules and loss functions to place computations on the GPU. When working on **Google Colab**, make sure that you changed your runtime to GPU from the above menu.\n",
